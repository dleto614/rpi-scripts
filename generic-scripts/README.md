# Scripts:

This folder is just to hold generic scripts that I use either to extract data or to configure certain things.

------

For the `extract_handshakes.sh` script, you need to install `cap2hccapx` so the pcap created by bettercap can be converted to format that hashcat uses.

------

Future plans:

- Write a script to enable the AP hotspot via nmcli
- Probably more install scripts or similar
